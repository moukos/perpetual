(* Interesting, Adir et al claims this is allowed, but 
   my reading is that to be allowed, it requires "non-cumulative"
   barriers *)
(* Hard example, the local dependency on stores in P0
   must not be seen by P1, justify the patch of alien stores,
   and finally the introduction of store buffers *)
